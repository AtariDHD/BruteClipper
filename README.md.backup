# BruteClipper

Windows utility to paste text into apps with clipboard functions disabled. Copy functionality is in development and will take a screenshot and then OCR the text, once it's working.

## Usage
1. Open the BruteClipper.sln solution in Visual Studio. It contains a C# Winforms project. Either debug the project or build and run the executable in bin/debug.
2. The application will add an icon to your taskbar tray when launched. Find the icon and click to open the application.
3. Click the "Change Paste Hotkey" button.
4. In the shortcut configuration dialog that opens, check off the modifier keys and select a hotkey. Example: CTRL-ALT-V
5. Click OK.
6. Close or minimize the window. The application will remain running in the system tray.
7. Copy text from any application.
8. Focus the application you want to paste into.
9. Press the hotkey.
10. After a small pause, the text will slowly be pasted into the application. It "pastes" by simulating keystrokes.
11. If you need to close BruteClipper, right-click on the tray icon and choose Exit.

**Note:** The next time you launch the application, it should recall the hotkey you last configured.

**Note:** If the application you are attempting to copy/paste was launched in Administrator mode, you must also launch Brute Clipper in Administrator mode.
